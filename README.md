# HOW TO USE

# Project End
Well, yes. The Project will get shutted down soon, after the V4-5 version. Don't Worry! even tho is will shutdown it doesn't mean at ALL that i'm gonna STOP creating small Projects.


# V2
We are currently working, on the V2 version of Fortnite Console. This is a small Project i made for fun tho, after the V2 you can do whatever you want with the source code of the Project. It will still have Updates maybe like V3 but as soon as V2 releases, you can steal, yoink, skid this Project. For right now you CAN NOT just fully steal it, you can ONLY get some code from here.

# LICENSE
I don't even care, use my code if you wanna use it.
